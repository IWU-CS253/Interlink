## First Iteration: Nov 7 - Nov 12, 2025
Iteration Tasks:
    -     (Elle) As a league admin, I want to create a new league for a specific sport, season, and              scheduling rules so that I can organize competitions.
    Priority: 1
    Estimate: Long, because it requires us to first implement all the logic regarding how data is stored.        We would need to have the main pages set up for at least displaying teams to test that the leagues are       able to be created, and the basic form to input information for league creation
    Confirmation:
     1. Ensure league information is stored
     2. Ensure league information is displayed correctly
     3. Ensure players can be added to the league as well as teams
