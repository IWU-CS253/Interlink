  - Ensure schedule generation creates all required matchups
  - Ensure each team plays the other twice
  - Ensure no scheduling conflicts or overlaps occur

### What Was Completed:

All planned user stories for this iteration were completed and merged into main.

There were additional unittests added by Hayden

We also began to work on one of the stretch goals, which was implementing 
a Google calendar to display when events/matches are scheduled

### What Was Planned But Not Finished

*Accessibility review of code and fixes*

*Complete unittests for every implemented feature*

### Troubles/Issues/Roadblocks/Difficulties Encountered

*Google Calendar Implementation*
- The calendar caused some issues with the imports and our current tests, so
we commented out the import code for now.

### Adjustments to Overall Design

*N/A*

### One Helpful Approach

*Same as last week: Being Proactive*
- It helps that our team members are very communicative and proactive with this project. For example, some people were
more productive with their task and finished quickly, and instead of sitting back, made small tweaks with styling and
back-end functionality. This makes our process later much smoother, as it could reduce the debugging we need to do
and also helps with the features we have yet to implement. 

### New: Important Thing We Learned

- It actually seems that as the project gets closer to being finished, we realize there is more to do than we
originally mapped out. One major thing being code commenting and keeping up with the accessibility requirements.
However, our planning ahead and earlier proactive-ness paid off because it left us with a lot of time to work on 
our stretch goals and additional features that make our application more complex
